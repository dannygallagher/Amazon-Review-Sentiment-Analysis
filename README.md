# CIS519-Project: Predicting Sentiment of Amazon Reviews
Tom Donnelly, William Fallon, Dan Gallagher

In this project we sought to apply different machine learning models to predict the star rating of Amazon reviews using only the associated text. We first applied a series of preprocessing methods to clean our data. Next, we implemented a series of simple models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and Bigrams, to serve as a baseline for performance. Finally, we implemented and hand-tuned deep learning models, including CNN’s, RNN’s, and transformers. Once implemented, we varied several model settings, including optimizer choice, product categories, and binary vs. neutral vs. five class prediction, to analyze how our models performed in different scenarios. Our results indicated that deep learning models were significantly better than our baseline at analyzing sentiment and predicting star ratings. Of the deep learning models we trained, BERT_BASE had the best performance.
