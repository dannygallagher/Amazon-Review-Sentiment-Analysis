        "\n",
        "If you have never used python or Jupyter notebooks before, we recommend bookmarking these resources:\n",
        "- Python: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/\n",
        "- Jupyter: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "Be aware that the Google tutorial uses python2, so some of their example code may not directly work in python3:\n",
        "- Print statements now require parentheses: `print x` now becomes `print(x)`\n",
        "- No longer need to specify file encoding: `open('file.txt', 'r')` works\n",
        "- The division operator `/` no longer does integer divison: `5 / 2` is `2.5`\n",
        "- The `xrange` operator is now only `range`\n",

        "## About Python\n",
        "Python is a programming language that is very popular among the machine learning research community.\n",
        "It is a higher-level programming language than Java, and has an extensive collection of libraries that can be easily installed.\n",
        "We require that you use python for this class, so it is important to be familiar with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python vs Java\n",
        "- Java is compiled, but Python is not: you directly run the Python file\n",
        "- Java is statically typed (the types of the variables cannot change), and you do not declare types in Python\n",
        "```\n",
        "# This works in python\n",
        "x = 3\n",
        "x = \"python\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "- Instantiating a class in Python does not use `new`\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Assume there is a class called `Person`\n",
        "p = Person('Emily', 25)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- Python does not use parentheses, like Java. Instead, it uses whitespace to infer the scope of methods, for loops, etc.\n",

        "for i in range(10):\n",

        "- Python uses hard brackets `[]` for indexing arrays and matrices instead of `()` in Matlab\n",

For supervised machine learning, we need to split our data into sets on which we train our models, validate how well different iterations of our models perform (which we can use to tune and improve the model), and finally evaluate how the final model performs. Sklearn allows us to split the data easily using the train_test_split function. The function is quite well documented, so we encourage you to check out how it works for the specifics, but will run an example here."
