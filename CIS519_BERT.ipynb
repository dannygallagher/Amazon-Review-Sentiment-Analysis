I\\'ve ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!\\n\\nThe little brown box is about 4.5\" x 3\" x 1\" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.\\n\\nOpen the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the \"Thank you\" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.\\n\\nIt arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.\\n\\nWould it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.\\n\\nRecommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!\\n\\nIdeas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other \"thank you\" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.\\n\\nAt the time I\\'m writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts.

I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.\", text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=1018, text_a='Good food', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=1486, text_a='Satisfied.', text_b=None, label=3), InputExample(guid=931, text_a='Kids love them', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=1412, text_a='convenient gift', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=2121, text_a='What a great gift this nade!', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=1750, text_a='Family gathering', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=1674, text_a='These were for the grandchildren and they lover themChristmas giftsstocking stuffers.', text_b=None, label=4), InputExample(guid=2705, text_a='This Santa Tin is really cute.
